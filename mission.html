                <h3><strong>Mission</strong></h3>
                <p class="justified-text">
                    To meet the globally competitive ambitions of a knowledge-based economy, the quality and size of the ‘pool’ of young people engaged in mainstream mathematics education is crucial. It is also this pool that feeds the supply of scientists needed within industry to perform the most demanding roles in areas that are crucial to the ongoing economic prosperity of the country.
                </p>
                <p class="justified-text">
                    Mathematical skills underpin attributes such as problem-solving, which are of critical importance within modern industrial environments. In order for adults to function reasonably well in an increasingly complex world, they require a basic level of mathematical knowledge necessary in a range of life skills, such as personal finance and data-handling.
                </p>
                <p class="justified-text">
                    Lack of sufficient mathematical skill and understanding affects one’s ability to make critically important educational, life, and career decisions. Thus, Mathematics is a core skill for life.
                </p>
                <p class="justified-text">
                    In spite of its importance, "Math" is often a subject that evokes emotions ranging from dislike and anxiety to outright fear. Students fall below their expected level of mathematics achievement for a variety of reasons. When asked why they were not as successful in learning mathematics, many reply that they “never understood math,” or “never liked it because it was too abstract and did not relate to real life.”
                </p>

                <h3><strong>Vision</strong></h3>
                <p class="justified-text">
                    We started Poorwa Tutorials to help students overcome this math phobia through various tools & techniques so that they gradually start loving Math. Our mission is to create a learning environment that helps students enjoy and appreciate the value of mathematics, develop the tools they need for varied educational and career options, and function effectively as citizens.
                </p>
                <p class="justified-text">
                    Our vision of excellent mathematical education is based on the twin premises that all students can learn mathematics and that all students need to learn mathematics. It is therefore imperative that we offer mathematics education of the very highest quality to all children.
                </p>
                <p class="justified-text">
                    We believe that mathematics instruction must provide many opportunities for concept building, relevant challenging questions, problem solving, reasoning, and connections within the curriculum and real-world situations.
                </p>
                <p class="justified-text">
                    MathsByPoorwa.com offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and tutorials that empower students to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. It’s fun & free. We believe that money shouldn't be a barrier to good education.
